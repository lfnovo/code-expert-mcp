## üìä LLM Prioritization Score: Weighting Logic

This score is designed to help prioritize source files for LLM-based code understanding by estimating how "informative" each file is to the model.

```python
def calculate_llm_priority_score(total_ccn, max_ccn, function_count, total_nloc):
    return (1.5 * total_ccn) + (2 * function_count) + (1.2 * max_ccn) + (0.05 * total_nloc)

üß† Why This Score?

When analyzing large codebases, you often can‚Äôt feed everything into the LLM at once. So we need to ask:

‚ÄúWhich files give the most value per token for helping the LLM understand the codebase?‚Äù

This scoring system gives higher priority to files that are:
	‚Ä¢	Rich in logical structure and branching
	‚Ä¢	Full of named semantic entry points (functions/methods)
	‚Ä¢	Informative and dense in content

‚öñÔ∏è Weight Breakdown

Metric	Weight	Why It‚Äôs Included
total_ccn	√ó1.5	Total cyclomatic complexity ‚Äî shows how much logical branching exists overall.
function_count	√ó2	More functions = more names, parameters, and structure for the LLM to learn from.
max_ccn	√ó1.2	Captures the most complex function as a ‚Äúhot spot‚Äù of logic in the file.
nloc (lines of code)	√ó0.05	Gives an idea of raw content size and token cost ‚Äî lightly weighted.

üéØ Summary
	‚Ä¢	Logic (CCN) is prioritized heavily ‚Äî tells us how much behavioral complexity the file contains.
	‚Ä¢	Structure (function count) is prioritized heavily ‚Äî tells us how many reusable entry points the file offers.
	‚Ä¢	Size (NLOC) is lightly weighted ‚Äî helps balance token budget without dominating the score.

You can adjust weights based on your goals, but this default balances logic depth, semantic richness, and size for most LLM-based code understanding workflows.
