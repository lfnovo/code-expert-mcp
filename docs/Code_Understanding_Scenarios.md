## Example Scenario: Accelerating Developer Onboarding to a Complex Codebase

### The Challenge

Michael is a senior developer at a financial technology company that has just acquired a startup with a promising trading algorithm implementation. The acquired codebase is complex, with minimal documentation, and the original developers are only available for a limited transition period. Michael needs to onboard his team to understand, maintain, and eventually enhance this codebase.

### With MCP Code Understanding Server

**Michael**: "I need to quickly understand the architecture of this trading algorithm repository and prepare onboarding materials for my team."

**AI Assistant**: "I can help analyze the repository to extract its key architectural patterns and create onboarding documentation. First, I'll need to clone the repository for analysis."

*[AI uses the MCP Code Understanding Server to clone the repository]*

**AI Assistant**: "I've begun cloning the repository. Now, let me retrieve the repository structure to understand its organization."

*[AI requests repository structure from the MCP server]*

**AI Assistant**: "I can see the repository structure now. Next, let me identify the critical files by analyzing complexity metrics."

*[AI requests critical files analysis from the MCP server]*

**AI Assistant**: "Based on the critical files analysis, I'll now examine the documentation available in the repository."

*[AI requests repository documentation from the MCP server]*

**AI Assistant**: "To understand the component relationships, I need to build a semantic map of the codebase."

*[AI requests source repository map from the MCP server]*

**AI Assistant**: "Let me examine the contents of some key files to understand the core algorithms."

*[AI requests file contents for specific files from the MCP server]*

**AI Assistant**: "I've completed my analysis of the trading algorithm repository. Here's what I've learned:

1. The codebase is organized into three main components:
   - Data ingestion (`src/ingestion/`)
   - Strategy implementation (`src/strategies/`)
   - Execution engine (`src/execution/`)

2. The critical files that contain the core algorithm logic appear to be:
   - `src/strategies/momentum_algo.py`
   - `src/strategies/risk_manager.py`
   - `src/execution/order_manager.py`

Would you like me to generate an architectural overview document to help with onboarding?"

**Michael**: "Yes, please create an architectural overview, and also identify any dependencies or external systems the code interacts with."

*[AI requests file contents for dependency configuration files from the MCP server]*

*[AI analyzes import statements across key files using the repository map]*

**AI Assistant**: "I've generated an architectural overview document that includes:

1. Component structure and responsibilities
2. Key workflow diagrams
3. External dependencies and integration points
4. Configuration parameters and their impacts

I've also identified that the system:
- Connects to three external market data providers through adapters in `src/ingestion/providers/`
- Uses a proprietary risk calculation library referenced in `requirements.txt`
- Persists data using both PostgreSQL and Redis, configured in `config/databases.yml`

This should give your team a solid foundation for understanding the system architecture."

**Michael**: "Can you also identify any potential areas of technical debt or code quality issues that we should address?"

*[AI analyzes code complexity metrics from the MCP server]*

*[AI requests contents of test files and analyzes test coverage]*

**AI Assistant**: "Based on code quality analysis, I've identified several areas for attention:

1. The error handling in `src/execution/order_manager.py` is inconsistent, with some errors caught and logged while others might cause silent failures
2. There's significant code duplication in the data provider adapters
3. The configuration management relies heavily on global variables
4. Test coverage appears to be minimal for the risk management module

Would you like me to generate a detailed technical debt assessment with recommended refactoring priorities?"

### The Outcome

With the help of the AI assistant powered by the MCP Code Understanding Server:

1. Michael's team gained a comprehensive understanding of the acquired codebase in days rather than weeks
2. The technical debt assessment allowed for strategic planning of refactoring efforts
3. Junior developers followed a structured learning path that minimized overwhelm
4. The team documented key architectural decisions and patterns
5. Knowledge transfer from the original development team was more efficient and focused

The MCP Code Understanding Server enabled the AI to extract knowledge from the codebase through a series of targeted analysis steps (cloning, structure analysis, critical file identification, documentation retrieval, semantic mapping, and specific file examination), providing insights that would have taken extensive manual investigation.


## Example Scenario: API Migration Planning

### The Challenge

Emma is a technical lead at a SaaS company that has built their product on a third-party payment processing API. The payment provider has announced that their current API (v1) will be deprecated in 6 months, requiring migration to a completely redesigned API (v2). Emma's team faces several challenges:

1. Their application has grown organically over 5 years with multiple developers contributing
2. API calls are scattered throughout the codebase with varying implementations
3. Some endpoints have custom error handling and retry logic
4. There's limited documentation on how the API is being used across their application

Emma estimates it would take weeks of manual code review to identify all API usage patterns and create a comprehensive migration plan.

### With MCP Code Understanding Server

**Emma**: "We need to migrate from PaymentProvider API v1 to v2 in the next 6 months. Can you help me understand how extensively we're using the API and create a migration plan?"

**AI Assistant**: "I can help analyze your codebase to identify all PaymentProvider API usage patterns and create a migration plan. First, I'll need to clone your repository."

*[AI uses the MCP Code Understanding Server to clone the repository]*

**AI Assistant**: "I've started cloning your repository. Let me examine the repository structure to understand the organization."

*[AI requests repository structure from the MCP server]*

**AI Assistant**: "Now I'll search for all files that might contain references to the PaymentProvider API."

*[AI searches files for import statements and API usage patterns]*

**AI Assistant**: "Let me analyze the critical files to understand the API usage patterns."

*[AI requests source repository map from MCP server focusing on payment-related components]*

**AI Assistant**: "I'll extract the specific API calls and examine their implementation details."

*[AI requests contents of files containing API calls]*

**AI Assistant**: "Based on my analysis, I've identified the following PaymentProvider API usage patterns in your codebase:

1. **Direct API Usage**: 32 files with 147 direct API calls across 8 different endpoints
2. **Wrapper Classes**: 3 internal wrapper classes in `src/services/payment/` that abstract API calls
3. **Custom Error Handling**: 5 different error handling strategies, with 2 implementing custom retry logic
4. **Webhook Handlers**: 4 webhook endpoints in `src/controllers/webhooks/` processing asynchronous notifications

Would you like me to categorize these by migration complexity?"

**Emma**: "Yes, please categorize them by migration complexity and also identify any potential high-risk areas."

*[AI analyzes complexity of each API usage pattern]*

*[AI examines error handling and integration points]*

**AI Assistant**: "Here's a breakdown of migration complexity:

**Low Complexity (40% of usage)**
- Standard API calls through wrapper classes
- Simple parameter mapping with minimal business logic
- Endpoints with direct equivalents in v2 API

**Medium Complexity (35% of usage)**
- Custom error handling requiring updates
- Business logic intertwined with API responses
- Endpoints requiring parameter restructuring in v2

**High Complexity (25% of usage)**
- Custom retry logic depending on specific v1 behavior
- Webhook handlers relying on v1-specific payload formats
- Transaction sequencing logic that differs in v2 architecture

The highest risk areas are:
1. The settlement reconciliation module in `src/services/reconciliation/` which depends heavily on v1-specific transaction statuses
2. The retry mechanism in `src/services/payment/retries.js` which makes assumptions about v1 idempotency guarantees

Would you like me to outline a phased migration approach?"

**Emma**: "That would be very helpful. Also, can you identify any v1 API features we're using that don't have direct equivalents in v2?"

*[AI compares API usage against v2 documentation]*

**AI Assistant**: "I've created a phased migration plan and identified API compatibility issues:

**Phase 1: Foundation (2 weeks)**
- Create v2 API client and wrapper classes
- Implement mapping layer between v1 and v2 data models
- Set up parallel logging for comparison testing

**Phase 2: Low-Risk Migrations (4 weeks)**
- Migrate all standard API calls through wrapper classes
- Update simple webhook handlers
- Implement comprehensive testing framework

**Phase 3: Complex Migrations (6 weeks)**
- Redesign retry mechanism for v2 compatibility
- Update reconciliation logic for new transaction model
- Migrate custom error handling strategies

**Phase 4: Verification & Cleanup (2 weeks)**
- Remove v1 dependencies
- Comprehensive regression testing
- Performance optimization for v2 patterns

**API Compatibility Issues**:
1. Batch settlement API in v1 has been split into multiple endpoints in v2
2. Idempotency handling differs significantly, requiring changes to your retry logic
3. Webhook payload formats have different notification timing and structure
4. Transaction status flow has more intermediate states in v2"

### The Outcome

With the help of the AI assistant powered by the MCP Code Understanding Server:

1. Emma's team identified all API usage patterns in hours rather than weeks
2. They gained a comprehensive understanding of integration complexity across their codebase
3. The team created a realistic, phased migration plan with accurate timeline estimates
4. They identified high-risk areas early, allowing focused testing and risk mitigation
5. The migration was completed successfully before the deprecation deadline

The MCP Code Understanding Server enabled the AI to perform in-depth analysis of API usage patterns across a complex codebase, providing insights that would have required extensive manual investigation and specialized knowledge of both the application architecture and the payment provider's APIs.

## Example Scenario: Security Vulnerability Assessment

### The Challenge

Jason is a security engineer at a healthcare technology company that develops applications handling sensitive patient data. A similar healthcare application has just disclosed a critical vulnerability involving improper data sanitization that could allow SQL injection attacks. Jason needs to quickly assess if their own codebase contains similar vulnerabilities before the vulnerability becomes widely exploited.

With over 200,000 lines of code across multiple services and a small security team, manually reviewing all database interaction points would take weeks – time they don't have given the urgency of the potential threat.

### With MCP Code Understanding Server

**Jason**: "A competing healthcare application just disclosed a critical SQL injection vulnerability in their patient data API. We need to urgently check if our codebase has similar vulnerabilities in how we handle user input before database queries."

**AI Assistant**: "I'll help you perform a security vulnerability assessment focusing on potential SQL injection risks. Let me first clone your repository."

*[AI uses the MCP Code Understanding Server to clone the repository]*

**AI Assistant**: "I've started cloning your repository. Let me analyze the repository structure to understand its organization."

*[AI requests repository structure from the MCP server]*

**AI Assistant**: "Now I'll identify the critical files that interact with your database."

*[AI requests critical files analysis from the MCP server]*

**AI Assistant**: "Let me search for all database interaction points and input processing patterns."

*[AI searches for database query patterns, input sanitization methods, and data access layers]*

**AI Assistant**: "I need to examine your database access layer implementation to understand your sanitization approach."

*[AI requests file contents for database-related files]*

**AI Assistant**: "Based on my analysis, I've identified:

1. **Database Interaction Points**: 47 files containing direct database queries
2. **Input Processing Patterns**: 3 main patterns for handling user input
3. **Sanitization Methods**: 2 different sanitization approaches depending on the service

Let me categorize the findings by risk level."

*[AI analyzes vulnerability potential based on sanitization patterns]*

**AI Assistant**: "Here's my vulnerability assessment:

**High Risk (Immediate Attention Required)**
- 12 endpoints in the `PatientSearch` API (`src/api/patient/search.js`) use string concatenation for SQL queries with external inputs
- The legacy admin interface (`src/admin/users/manage.js`) bypasses the ORM for custom queries with minimal sanitization
- 3 reporting endpoints (`src/reports/`) use raw SQL with parameters inserted using string replacement

**Medium Risk (Require Review)**
- Integration service uses parameterized queries but doesn't validate input types
- Batch processing system handles sanitization at the application level rather than using database parameters
- Custom analytics queries use special characters that might bypass standard sanitization

**Low Risk (Well Protected)**
- Main application uses ORM with parameterized queries
- API gateway implements input validation and type checking before processing
- Authentication services use prepared statements exclusively

Would you like me to recommend immediate mitigation steps for the high-risk areas?"

**Jason**: "Yes, please provide mitigation recommendations and also show me specific examples of the vulnerable code patterns so I can search for similar instances."

*[AI retrieves specific code examples of vulnerable patterns]*

**AI Assistant**: "Here are the vulnerable patterns and recommended mitigations:

**Pattern 1: String Concatenation in Queries**
```
// Vulnerable pattern in src/api/patient/search.js
const query = `SELECT * FROM patients WHERE last_name LIKE '${userInput}%'`;
```

**Mitigation**: Replace with parameterized queries:
```
const query = `SELECT * FROM patients WHERE last_name LIKE $1`;
const params = [`${userInput}%`];
```

**Pattern 2: Raw SQL Execution**
```
// Vulnerable pattern in src/admin/users/manage.js
db.execute("UPDATE users SET role = '" + roleInput + "' WHERE id = " + idInput);
```

**Mitigation**: Use the ORM's sanitization mechanisms:
```
db.users.update({
  where: { id: parseInt(idInput, 10) },
  data: { role: roleInput }
});
```

**Pattern 3: String Replacement in SQL**
```
// Vulnerable pattern in src/reports/monthly.js
const sql = "SELECT * FROM treatments WHERE date BETWEEN '%start%' AND '%end%'"
  .replace('%start%', startDate)
  .replace('%end%', endDate);
```

**Mitigation**: Use query parameters:
```
const sql = "SELECT * FROM treatments WHERE date BETWEEN ? AND ?";
executeQuery(sql, [startDate, endDate]);
```

I'd also recommend:
1. Implementing a pre-commit hook to detect string concatenation in SQL queries
2. Adding automated security scanning to your CI/CD pipeline
3. Creating a centralized database access layer that enforces parameterization
4. Conducting targeted security training for developers working on the high-risk components"

**Jason**: "Can you help me create a comprehensive testing plan to verify all instances have been fixed once we implement these changes?"

*[AI analyzes testing options based on the codebase structure]*

**AI Assistant**: "Here's a testing plan to verify vulnerability remediation:

1. **Static Analysis**:
   - Run SQL injection-focused static analysis tools against the codebase
   - Create custom linting rules to detect the specific vulnerable patterns

2. **Dynamic Testing**:
   - Create parameterized integration tests for each high-risk endpoint
   - Implement fuzzing tests with SQL injection payloads
   - Set up API security scanning with OWASP ZAP

3. **Manual Verification**:
   - Conduct manual code review of all changes in the high-risk components
   - Perform penetration testing focusing on the identified vulnerable endpoints
   - Verify parameterization is correctly implemented across database layers

4. **Continuous Monitoring**:
   - Add SQL query logging in development/staging environments
   - Implement WAF rules to detect SQL injection attempts
   - Create alerts for unusual query patterns

I can also provide specific test cases for each high-risk component if needed."

### The Outcome

With the help of the AI assistant powered by the MCP Code Understanding Server:

1. Jason's team identified all potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in hours instead of weeks
2. They prioritized remediation efforts based on risk assessment
3. The team implemented fixes for high-risk vulnerabilities before exploitation occurred
4. They established improved security practices and testing procedures
5. The incident led to a more robust security posture with minimal disruption

The MCP Code Understanding Server enabled the AI to perform targeted security analysis across a complex codebase, providing actionable insights about vulnerability patterns and specific remediation strategies that would have required extensive specialized security knowledge and manual code review.
