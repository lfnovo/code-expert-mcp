# Domain configuration for Let's Encrypt (OPTIONAL but RECOMMENDED)
# If you have a domain in Route 53, uncomment and configure these:
# domain_name     = "code-expert.yourdomain.com"
# route53_zone_id = "ZXXXXXXXXXXXXX"  # Run ./get-zone-id.sh to find your zone ID

# Without a domain, the server will use a self-signed certificate
# which may cause issues with Claude Desktop
