# OSS-251 Auto-Refresh System - Context Understanding

## Executive Summary

The Auto-Refresh System automates repository updates in the Code Expert MCP server, eliminating manual refresh operations while optimizing resource usage based on repository activity patterns and deployment contexts.

## Why This Is Being Built (Context)

### Current Pain Points
- Users must manually trigger `refresh_repo` to update repositories
- No awareness of repository activity levels or access patterns  
- Manual process doesn't scale for teams with multiple active projects
- Inefficient for teams working with frequently updated repositories

### Business Need
- Repositories need to stay current without manual intervention
- System should be intelligent about refresh frequency based on actual activity
- Resource usage must be optimized while maintaining code freshness

## Expected Outcome (Goal)

### Primary Objectives
1. **Automatic Repository Synchronization**: Repositories stay current without user intervention
2. **Intelligent Refresh Scheduling**: 
   - Active repos (commits < 7 days old): refresh every 24h
   - Inactive repos (commits >= 7 days old): refresh every 7 days
3. **Resource Optimization**: System adapts refresh frequency to actual repository activity
4. **Deployment Flexibility**: Support both local and web deployments with appropriate features
5. **Future-Ready Architecture**: Designed to support incremental vector embedding

### Success Metrics
- 90% reduction in manual refresh operations
- <10% increase in baseline CPU/memory consumption
- >95% successful automatic refresh operations
- Repository availability within 30 seconds of refresh trigger

## How It Should Be Built (Approach)

### Core Architecture Components
```
AutoRefreshManager
├─ ConfigManager → Handles user-configurable intervals and thresholds
├─ RepositoryScheduler → Manages refresh scheduling per repository
├─ RefreshExecutor → Executes refresh pipeline with resource limits
├─ MetadataTracker → Updates repository metadata with refresh history
└─ WebhookHandler → [Web only] Processes webhook-triggered refreshes
```

### Integration Strategy
- **Extend existing infrastructure**: Build on current `RepositoryManager` and `RepositoryCache`
- **Non-breaking integration**: Preserve all existing manual refresh functionality
- **Configuration-driven**: Use YAML configuration system already in place
- **Background processing**: Leverage existing async patterns and task scheduling

### Refresh Pipeline
1. **Repository Analysis**: Calculate last commit age and determine activity level
2. **Refresh Execution**: Git pull → RepoMap rebuild → Critical files analysis
3. **Rescheduling**: Update metadata and calculate next refresh time

## Dependencies and Integration Points

### Existing Systems Integration
- **RepositoryManager**: Extend with auto-refresh capabilities
- **RepositoryCache**: Add refresh scheduling metadata
- **Configuration System**: Extend existing YAML config with auto-refresh settings
- **Current refresh_repository method**: Use as-is for actual refresh operations

### New Dependencies
- **Background Task Scheduler**: For managing refresh timing
- **Configuration Validation**: Ensure safe interval values
- **Webhook Endpoint** (optional): For web deployment triggered refreshes

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Configuration validation and parsing
- Repository activity analysis logic
- Refresh scheduling calculations
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

### Integration Testing  
- End-to-end refresh pipeline execution
- Configuration changes taking effect
- Resource limits and concurrent refresh management
- Startup refresh sequence

### Performance Testing
- System resource usage under various refresh loads
- Concurrent refresh operations
- Large repository handling

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing manual refresh
- Resource limits must prevent system overload
- Git operations may fail due to network issues
- File system operations require proper locking

### Deployment Constraints
- Local deployments: Limited to basic scheduling, no webhooks
- Web deployments: Can support webhook integration with rate limiting
- Configuration must adapt to deployment context automatically

### Assumptions
- Repositories have git remotes for activity analysis
- System has network access for git operations
- Current async patterns can support additional background tasks
- YAML configuration is preferred approach for settings

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Race Conditions**: Use existing per-repository locks from refresh_repository
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Implement configurable concurrency limits with semaphore throttling
- **Configuration Errors**: Comprehensive validation with safe defaults

### Operational Risks  
- **Startup Load**: Staggered execution with configurable delays
- **Network Dependencies**: Exponential backoff with maximum retry limits
- **User Adoption**: Preserve manual options, clear documentation

## Implementation Scope

### All Phases Implementation
**Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**
- AutoRefreshManager with basic scheduling
- Configuration system integration  
- Repository activity analysis
- Integration with existing refresh_repository
- Startup refresh with staggered execution

**Phase 2: Advanced Features**
- Webhook handler with rate limiting
- Error handling with exponential backoff
- Resource limits and concurrent refresh management
- Enhanced metadata tracking

**Phase 3: Observability & Polish**
- Comprehensive logging of refresh decisions
- Deployment mode detection (local vs web)
- Configuration validation and error messages
- Documentation and migration guide

## Architecture Validation

This approach aligns with the existing codebase patterns:
- ✅ Uses existing RepositoryManager and RepositoryCache infrastructure
- ✅ Leverages current YAML configuration system
- ✅ Maintains async/await patterns throughout
- ✅ Preserves existing functionality while adding new capabilities
- ✅ Follows established logging and error handling practices
